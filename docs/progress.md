# WeQuo Project Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-09-12

This document summarizes the progress of the WeQuo project, outlining what has been completed and what remains to be done.

## Current Status

The project is currently in a good state. **Phase 1 of the roadmap is largely complete.** We have a functioning data pipeline that can ingest data from multiple sources, perform analysis, and generate weekly data packages for authors.

### What's Been Done

*   **Data Pipeline (`scripts/run_weekly.py`):**
    *   A robust data pipeline is in place that can be run from the command line.
    *   It loads configuration from `src/wequo/config.yml`, which allows for easy management of connectors and other parameters.
    *   It fetches data from multiple sources using the connector framework.
    *   It normalizes the data and saves it to CSV files.
    *   It performs data validation and generates a QA report.
    *   It runs an analytics engine to generate insights from the data.

*   **Data Connectors (`src/wequo/connectors/`):**
    *   A flexible connector framework has been established.
    *   Connectors for several key data sources have been implemented:
        *   FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
        *   Commodities
        *   Cryptocurrencies
        *   Economic indicators (World Bank)
    *   Connectors for GitHub and weather have been created but are disabled by default.
    *   Most connectors include mock data generation for testing and fallback purposes.

*   **Analytics Engine (`src/wequo/analytics/`):**
    *   A powerful analytics engine has been developed to extract insights from the data.
    *   It can calculate deltas (changes) in the data.
    *   It can detect anomalies using z-scores.
    *   It can identify trends in the data.
    *   It generates a comprehensive analytics report in both JSON and Markdown formats.

*   **Authoring Tools (`src/wequo/tools/`):**
    *   A simple and effective set of tools has been created for authors.
    *   A web application (`run_web_app.py`) provides a user-friendly interface to:
        *   List available weekly data packages.
        *   View the contents of a data package.
        *   Generate a pre-filled Markdown template for the weekly brief.
    *   A command-line interface (`cli.py`) provides similar functionality for power users.

### What Needs to Be Done

Based on the project roadmap, the following tasks remain:

*   **Phase 2: Automation, Indexing, and Dashboard**
    *   **Dashboard:** Develop a comprehensive dashboard (using Vite + Vue 3 + D3.js) for data exploration and visualization.
    *   **Indexing and Search:** Index the data and reports into a searchable store (e.g., Elasticsearch, Weaviate) to enable semantic search.
    *   **Exportable Artifacts:** Add the ability to export the weekly brief to PDF and HTML formatss.

*   **Phase 3: Production Hardening and Advanced Analytics**
    *   **Advanced Analytics:** Enhance the analytics engine with more advanced techniques, such as change-point detection and cross-correlation analysis. 
    *   **Strongly Interpreting the Data:** Implement methods to convert raw data into language that is easily interpretable by non-technical users.
    *   **Scalability:** Optimize the data connectors and storage for scalability to handle a larger volume of data.
    *   **Author Review Workflow:** Implement a workflow for author reviews, approvals, and version history.

*   **Phase 4: Productization and Handoff**
    *   **UX Polish:** Refine the user experience of the authoring tools and dashboard.
    *   **Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation and onboarding materials for operators.
    *   **Handoff to Ops:** Prepare the project for a smooth handoff for ongoing analysis.

*   **Data Provenance:**
    *   The `src/wequo/metadata.py` module has been created for tracking data provenance, but it needs to be fully integrated into the data pipeline.

## Next Steps

The immediate focus should be on the tasks outlined in **Phase 2** of the roadmap. This will involve:

1.  Beginning the development of a dashboard for users to explore data.
2.  Investigating and implementing a search and indexing solution.

By completing these tasks, we will move closer to a fully automated and user-friendly "Quant-in-a-box" solution.
